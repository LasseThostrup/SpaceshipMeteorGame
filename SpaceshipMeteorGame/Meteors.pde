//Class that keeps track of all the meteors, generate new and remove when they go out of bound
//Maybe have a thread that runs an generate new meteors

//Idea to methods
  //Constructor - Instantiate collection of meteors
  //newMeteor() - private? - Create a random placed new meteor at a specific depth
  //draw() - this method should be called by the SpaceshipMeteorGame's Draw() routine. Every time this method is called it should move the meteors closer to the spaceship.
  

class Meteors {
  int speed = 10; //Movement speed of meteors (z += speed) each time draw is called
  ArrayList meteors;
